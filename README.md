# KerbalFlightController
This is a Flight Controller/Stabilizer for Kerbal Space Program that uses the Kerbal Operating System Mod. This controller features better hold features than are offered in the default game including: a bank, heading, pitch, and altitude hold controller which are all able to be tuned and saved via the user interface. The tuning data is saved on command to a JSON file so the previous tune can be loaded again later. The benefit of a stability controller is that the player can fly more efficiently and with less effort, especially if the player lacks a joystick for fine control surface handling.

In the future, the primary goal is to add an auto-tune feature that will automatically tune any aircraft based on a flight.

Additional future features might include:
 - A drop down menu of waypoint options to fly to including waypoints from current missions and other Easter eggs in the game
 - An auto land and takeoff feature to takeoff and land the airplane automatically
 - A to-orbit feature to automatically fly SSTOs to an orbit
