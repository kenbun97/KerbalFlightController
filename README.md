# KerbalFlightController
This is a Flight Controller/Stabilizer for Kerbal Space Program that uses the Kerbal Operating System Mod. This controller features better hold features than are offered in the default game including: a bank hold controller and pitch hold controller which are all able to be tuned and saved via the user interface. The tuning data is saved on command to a JSON file so the previous tune can be loaded again later. The benefit of a stability controller is that the player fly more efficiently, especially if the player lacks a joystick for control surface manipulation. In the future, the primary goal is to add an auto-tune feature that will automatically tune any aircraft based on a flight. Additional future features might include a fly home feature to automatically fly back to the Kerbal Space Center, an auto land and takeoff feature to takeoff and land the airplane automatically, and a to-orbit feature to automatically fly SSTOs to an orbit.
